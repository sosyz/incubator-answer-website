## What’s New
Pin an important or frequently asked question for your Q&A platform, so that it always stay on the top of your community.

Unlist a question to make it invisible for temporary modification, or further review. Admin can list question again in Admin\>Contents\>Questions.

Pin and Unlist help to tailor a knowledge-based community of your own, while maintain and organize the knowledge system can be easy. 

## Bug Fixes & Optimization
We’ve also made some tweaks to fix the display issues of tags, comments form,  and stubborn deleted questions. We’ve also removed context ambiguity with optimized translation. 


We strongly recommend you to build and manage a Q&A platform [Answer v1.0.9](https://github.com/apache/incubator-answer/releases/tag/v1.0.9). You are always welcome to contribute your ideas (feature requests, or hunt a but) in [https://meta.answer.dev/](https://meta.answer.dev/). So what will you pin first?
