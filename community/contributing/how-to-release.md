# How to Release

All Apache projects are required to follow the [Apache Release Policy](https://www.apache.org/legal/release-policy.html). This guide is intended to help you understand the policy and how to release projects at Apache.

## Release Process

1. Create a GPG key if you don't have one.
2. Create a RC tag in the git repository and write the release notes.
3. Upload release artifacts to the dev Apache SVN.
4. Verify the release artifacts.
5. Start a vote.
6. Migration candidate to the release Apache SVN.
7. Create a release.
8. Update the Download page.
9. Announce the vote result and release.

## Create a GPG key

Create a GPG key if you don't have one. You can follow the instructions [here](https://www.apache.org/dev/openpgp.html).

```shell
# create a GPG key
$ gpg --full-generate-key

# list the GPG keys
$ gpg  --keyid-format SHORT --list-keys

# upload the GPG key to the key server, xxx is the GPG key id
$ gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-key xxx

# append the GPG key to the KEYS file the svn repository
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/answer/
$ (gpg --list-sigs xxx@apache.org && gpg --export --armor xxx@apache.org) >> KEYS
$ svn ci -m "add gpg key" 
```


## Upload the release artifacts to the dev Apache SVN

### Create a RC tag
When you want to release a new version, you need to create a new RC tag in the git repository firstly. The tag name should be `v{release-version}-RC{rc-version}`. This has the advantage of avoiding tag deletion.

* release-version: The version you want to release, such as 1.2.0.
* rc-version: The release candidate version, such as RC1.

```shell
$ git tag -a v{release-version}-RC{rc-version} -m "Release Apache Answer {release-version}"
$ git push origin v{release-version}-RC{rc-version}
```

After pushing the RC tag, CI will automatically generate the release page based on the tag. write the release notes in the release page. remember to select `Set as a pre-release` before clicking `Publish release`.

The release notes should choose a tag that is not the branch, such as `v1.2.0-RC1`.

### Sign the release artifacts

Sign the release artifacts with the GPG key. **Be careful to check that the binary file is complete to avoid a size of 0.**

```shell
# sign the release artifacts, xxxx is xxx@apache.org
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg --local-user xxxx --armor --output $i.asc --detach-sig $i ; done
```

### Create the checksums for the release artifacts

```shell
# create the checksums
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; sha512sum  $i > $i.sha512 ; done
```

### Upload to the svn repository
> **NOTICE** The repository address where the GPG key is created and the prepository address where the release artifacts are uploaded are not the same. The GPG key is uploaded to the `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/answer/` repository, and the release artifacts are uploaded to the `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/answer/` repository.

1. Create a directory for the release artifacts in the svn repository.
   ```shell
   $ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/answer/
   ```
2. Upload the release artifacts to the svn repository.
   ```shell
   $ cp /path/to/release/artifacts/* ./{release-version}/
   $ svn add ./{release-version}/*
   ```
3. release-version format: 1.2.0
   ```shell
   $ svn commit -m "add Apache Answer release artifacts for {release-version}"
   ```
The release artifacts should be uploaded to the `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/answer/{release-version}` directory.


**IMPORTANT** After completion, visit the link `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/answer/{release-version}` to check whether the file upload is correct.

## Verify the release artifacts

Following is the basic check items for the release artifacts.

- [ ] Download links are valid.
- [ ] Checksums and PGP signatures are valid.
- [ ] Source code distributions have correct names matching the current release.
- [ ] LICENSE and NOTICE files are correct for each Apache Answer repo.
- [ ] All files have license headers if necessary.
- [ ] No unlicensed compiled archives bundled in source archive.

### How to verify the signatures

```shell
# download KEYS
$ curl https://downloads.apache.org/answer/KEYS > KEYS

# import KEYS and trust the key, please replace the email address with the one you want to trust.
$ gpg --import KEYS
$ gpg --edit-key linkinstar@apache.org
gpg> trust
gpg> 5
gpg> y
gpg> quit

# enter the directory where the release artifacts are located
$ cd /path/to/release/artifacts

# verify the signature
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; gpg --verify $i.asc $i ; done

# if you see 'Good signature' in the output, it means the signature is valid.
```

### How to verify the checksums

```shell
# verify the checksums
$ for i in *.tar.gz; do echo $i; sha512sum --check  $i.sha512; done
```

finalize the process.
